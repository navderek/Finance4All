# This module will contain Cloud Run services
# For now, it's a placeholder until we have Docker images to deploy

# Placeholder - will be implemented when backend and frontend are ready
# Cloud Run service for backend API (GraphQL)
# Cloud Run service for frontend application

# Note: These will be created in Phase 1 and Phase 2
# For now, we're just reserving the module structure
